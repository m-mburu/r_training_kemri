## Functions

- A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing

### Functions Already used

```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- 11:20
sum(x)
mean(x)
cor(x, y)
```

-----

```{r}
lm_fit <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)

library(broom)


```

------

```{r}
options(digits = 4)
library(tidyverse)
tidy(lm_fit) %>% datatable()
```

----

### When should you write a function?
You should consider writing a function whenever youâ€™ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice

```{r}

```
